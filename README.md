# Showcase of Adaptive Monte Carlo Particle Filter for Robot Locatization

Abstract—This paper showcases a successfully implementation of a robot localization exercise using the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm. Two robots, a benchmark robot and a custom robot, were made to self-localize and navigate a maze in a simulation environment. The robots successfully navigated the maze and reached their desired final location by solely utilizing their onboard sensors data and the AMCL algorithm.
